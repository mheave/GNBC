			<p>Hard assets make sense in todays turbulent economic climate. There is nothing else on earth that offers the security of gold and silver. As an asset class, precious metals can't be beaten, as a store of wealth they are second to none. Remember, if you don't hold it, you don't own it.</p>

			<h2 class="featurette-heading">Why?</h2>
			<p class="lead">For over five thousand years civilisations have used gold and silver as a medium of exchange to enable trade. These metals had unique qualities, gold could not be simply printed into existence like paper currency, it had the same value anywhere in the world, it was divisible, durable and above all rare! Of course now gold and silver in not used as currency, rather we have been sold the lie that paper money is better. Every nation on earth now uses some form of paper currency, backed by nothing except a "promise to pay the bearer on demand". Sound familiar? it's written on our british currency today. Cash today is basically an IOU, backed by nothing. It's just paper.</p>
